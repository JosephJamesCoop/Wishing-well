        <h3>Sealing The Deal:</h3>
        <p className="paragraph">
          It was Independence Day in 2016 and my buddy Jason and I were
          attempting to throw an Epic Party at his house. We got drinks, snacks,
          the two coolest dudes in town and a dog. Like what else do you need to
          add to the equations for an epic party!? Apparently a lot more cause
          no one showed up even though like 70 people claimed to be on their way
          lol. Out of desperation Jason and I searched many socail media
          platforms attempting to steal people from one party and get them to
          ours. With hours and hours of no success we about gave up, then Jason
          very casually says looks like Erin is home alone, even though he knows
          I am like head over heels for Erin at this point. I immediatly beg him
          to invite her and he is like nah bro she is with Taylor and I'm like
          BRO she literally is saying boys suck, home alone, sad blahhh blahh
          blahh. To which Jason responded well if she is home alone she probably
          wants to be, took everything in me not to punch him... I was like we
          are home alone and we don't want to be so you never know now invite
          her. He does small talk and then eventually invites her over and she
          says yes. I am so pumped on life at this point! Once Erin arrives she
          is obviously sad and not happy so I sit down and start talking to her
          attempting to find out what is wrong and how to use my great sense of
          humor and my immaculate timing of jokes to cheer her up. After talking
          for a little while I find out this Taylor guy she is dating is kind of
          a giant piece of shit! But in my mind all I heard was "I am not happy
          in my current relationship so I'm pretty much single so you wouldn't
          but a jerk for trying to win my heart over and getting me to leave
          taylor for you". So I gave it my best, I reassured her of her value
          and right when I started to cheer her up, Jason's extremely drunk ass
          came on over and attemtped to cheer her up by being suepr creepy and
          telling her the same thing over and over again and then started being
          a HUGE cock block! But because I was a nice guy and Jason was being a
          creepy drunk at the moment it actually super worked in my favor and
          snagged her number. Come to find out we both have the same days off
          and she had no plans. So we made plans to go on a hike together the
          next day and after seeing her in her chacos thats when I fell in love.
          Not really, the chacos were almost a deal breaker but the time, laughs
          and company she provided made me fall in love.
