        <p className="paragraph">
        Well most of you may know that Erin and I met at BestBuy where we both
         worked. After daydreaming about her for months I stumbled upon her
         sitting alone in the breakroom. I said hello and was greeted with a
         non enthusiastic hello. Obvious that it was not the bestes of days
         for Erin I decided to try to cheer her up. I Started with the best
         question you can ask someone who is sad or upset I asked her "what's
         wrong?". She didn't even give me the time of day and mumbled the
         socially acceptable answer of "nothing". Only partially convinced by
         her answer I decided to continue on with my attempt to place her in a
         better mood by responding, "Well that sounded awfully convincing glad
         you're doing so well. My day hasn't been too bad, I got like 7K out
         already and I'm only half way through it!" And that was what got her
         to finally look up and make eye contact and in the most sincere tone
         she responded with, "wow... that is so awesome... cool... congrats?.."
         But I could see in her eye at this point that I needed to really make
         her smile so I whipped out one of the best jokes in the books. I was a
         gentleman however and warned her that it's more enjoyable to tell and
         asked who she lived with. She responded "my mom." So I told her I am
         going to tell you the best joke ever!!! and she has to tell her mom
         tonight, after asking her to agree multiple times, she finally agreed!
         (although now that I think about it I think she only agreed to get me to shut
         up because she was having a pretty crappy day). <br />
         <br />
         And so it began...
         <br />
         A bear walks into a bar.
         <br />
         Goes up to the bartender.
         <br />
         The bear slams his paws on the counter and says I'll have a glass of
         water..
         <br />
         *long awkward pause (I was kind and only did 15 seconds although my
         record is 4 days. Started the joke on our way to Colorado and finished
         it on our way back)*
         <br />
         ...With ice! The bartender looks at the bear.
         <br />
         He asks the bear, "What's with the big pause?"
         <br />
         Bear lifts up his paws and goes "I'm a bearrrr!!!"
          <br />
          <br />
          To my surprise not even a smile or a chuckle... I assumed I failed and
         tucked my tail between my legs and left the breakroom after only 3
         minutes. The next day I walked into the break room and saw Erin there
         again. After a good night's sleep and a fresh shower I had a bit more
         confidence in me to continue my attempt to swoon her with my charm. I
         asked if she told her mom the joke that I told her yesterday and to my
         surprise she did... I asked how was it what!? did she say!? Erin
         responded well "she kind of just stared at me very confused then
         said, 'well Erin, I'm glad you're making friends' then she walked
         away".

          <br />
          And that my friends is how I swooned Erin.
