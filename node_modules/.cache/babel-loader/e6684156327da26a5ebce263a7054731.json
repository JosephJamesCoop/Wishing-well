In reality I was very strategically poisitioning myself so I would always face customer service, especially whenever another employee would approach to tell me something usually of no value at all. Word was going around the store that my Supervisor Jessy was going to have a get together for his and another co-workers birthday at a local bar. I wanted to go but at the same time a night at the bar surrounded by drunks did not sound too exciting until... It was CONFIRMED! Erin was going to go, then my entire perspective on a night at the bar changed! I was like yeah Jessy I don't care if I'm invited or not I'll see you friday night! Friday night came by and I was ready to go, showed up with my buddy Jason and we were there to PARTY! We hung out said hi to everyone and then evntually made our way up stairs where I laid my eyes on her. All my confidence and energy went out the window and I imediatly shut down. Intimidated by her beauty and covered in tattoos with holes in her ears 3 times the size of mine. I lost all confidence and stuck my tail between my legs and sat down on the other side of the room from her. About 1 hour 7 minues and 35 seconds later, again it was about that much time later I don't know for sure but I think it was about 1 hour 7 minutes and 35 seconds later. A lady with about 40 roses came up stairs and was selling them for $5 each, I was like hell yeah, bought one and was imidiatly judged and questioned why I just wasted my money on a flower and who it was for. Under a lot of pressure and still not enough confidence to give it to Erin I did what most people do in a panic, I LIED! I lied hard and I lied good, my inner salesman came out and I sold the lie to a crowd of salesman and they bought it! It was for me, DUH! What a dude can't buy himself nice things to feel pretty and special? Maybe I'm going to take it home and plant a rose bed. Or maybe I am going to take it home and tell my roomates the cutest girl ever gave it to me! I don't know I haven't decided yet but you know what I do know, I just spent $5 on a world of opportunites that none of you will get to experience because you were to afraid to make the investment. Okay maybe they didn't buy it but they laughed pretty hard and it boosted my confidence. Thats when I noticed Erin's friend Danielle was no longer sitting next to her and I finally got some confidence and sat next to her with the rose in my hand. Something about my rear end connecting with the seat or maybe just the way I was sitting but literally all of my confidence went out the window once again. I started with small talk after a few hours of talking I learned she is beautiful on the outside and inside and also likes spongebob HUGE plus. But I also found out she has a boyfriend When it was time for us to leave Danielles boyfriend Mitch came up and was like hey someone just pulled a knife on someone in the parking lot do you need me to walk you out Erin? I looked over at Mitch and said oh I got this, I can walk her out he smiled back at me and Erin said okay. So I walked her to her car said goodbye and tossed her the rose on the passenger seat and watched her drive away.\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 8,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 6,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this)\n  }, void 0, false);\n}\n\n_c = FirstDate;\nexport default FirstDate;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"FirstDate\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/josephcooper/Desktop/wishing-well/src/components/pages/LongConvo/index.js"],"names":["React","FirstDate"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;;;;AAEA,SAASC,SAAT,GAAqB;AACnB,sBACE;AAAA,2BACE;AAAK,MAAA,KAAK,EAAC,SAAX;AAAA,8BACE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cADF,eAEE;AAAG,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAFF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADF,mBADF;AAwDD;;KAzDQA,S;AA2DT,eAAeA,SAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\";\n\nfunction FirstDate() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <div class=\"my-info\">\n        <h3>First Conversation Outside of Work:</h3>\n        <p className=\"paragraph\">\n          Well after spending months and months standing in the aisle in front\n          of my department \"waiting for customers\".
