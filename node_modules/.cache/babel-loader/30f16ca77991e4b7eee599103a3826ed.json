Out of desperation Jason and I searched many socail media platforms attempting to steal people from one party and get them to ours. With hours and hours of no success we about gave up, then Jason very casually says looks like Erin is home alone, even though he knows I am like head over heels for Erin at this point. I immediatly beg him to invite her and he is like nah bro she is with Taylor and I'm like BRO she literally is saying boys suck, home alone, sad blahhh blahh blahh. To which Jason responded well if she is home alone she probably wants to be, took everything in me not to punch him... I was like we are home alone and we don't want to be so you never know now invite her. He does small talk and then eventually invites her over and she says yes. I am so pumped on life at this point! Once Erin arrives she is obviously sad and not happy so I sit down and start talking to her attempting to find out what is wrong and how to use my great sense of humor and my immaculate timing of jokes to cheer her up. After talking for a little while I find out this Taylor guy she is dating is kind of a giant piece of shit! But in my mind all I heard was \\\"I am not happy in my current relationship so I'm pretty much single so you wouldn't but a jerk for trying to win my heart over and getting me to leave taylor for you\\\". So I gave it my best, I reassured her of her value and right when I started to cheer her up, Jason's extremely drunk ass came on over and attemtped to cheer her up by being suepr creepy and telling her the same thing over and over again and then started being a HUGE cock block! But because I was a nice guy and Jason was being a creepy drunk at the moment it actually super worked in my favor and snagged her number.
